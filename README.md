pip install torch torchvision numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

## Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps involve:
- Normalizing the images
- Resizing to a consistent dimension
- Converting to grayscale (if necessary)
- Data splitting (training, validation, testing)

## Data Augmentation
Augmentation techniques include:
- Random rotations
- Horizontal and vertical flips
- Random cropping
- Brightness and contrast adjustments
- Noise addition

## Model Architectures
### Simple Deep CNN
A straightforward CNN architecture with several convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

### ResNet
ResNet (Residual Network) introduces skip connections, allowing the model to learn residual functions. We will use a pre-trained ResNet and fine-tune it on our dataset.

### DenseNet
DenseNet (Densely Connected Convolutional Networks) connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. This architecture is known for alleviating the vanishing gradient problem and enhancing feature propagation.

## Training and Evaluation
Steps for training and evaluating the models:
- Define loss function and optimizer
- Train the models on the training set
- Validate the models on the validation set
- Evaluate performance on the test set
- Save the best performing models

## Results
After training and evaluation, the results will be analyzed to determine the performance of each model in detecting objects in night vision images. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be reported.

## Conclusion
This project aims to improve night vision capabilities by utilizing advanced CNN architectures. Through thorough experimentation and analysis, we hope to identify the most effective model for this task.

## Future Work
Future enhancements could include:
- Exploring other advanced CNN architectures
- Integrating temporal information for video sequences
- Implementing real-time object detection systems
- Applying transfer learning from other related tasks
